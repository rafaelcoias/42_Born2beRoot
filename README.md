# 42_Born2beRoot
<h3>Assignment</h3>

This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.

<h3>Goal</h3>

You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox)
under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up
your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

<h3>What you need to know before starting get_next_line</h3>

You can see what really is important for you to know in the <a href="https://github.com/rafaelcoias/42_Born2beRoot/tree/main/EVALUATION">EVALUATION</a> directory (in case you are doing Born2beRoot).

<h4>Operating System</h4> 

There are two different operating systems :

-  Debian is easier to use and has multiple architecture support. It can be easily upgraded and it comes with user-friendly applications. Uses apt-get as its package manager. Finally, Debian has a GUI.

-  CentOS it's (arguably) more secure and stable, due to the reserved nature and the lower frequency of its updates. CentOS also provides support for cPanel which Ubuntu lacks. Its package manager is Yum and has a complicated GUI. Finally, the community support and documentation is as good as it gets.

<h4>SSH and why is used</h4>

SSH or Secure Shell is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate and share data.
SSH connections have mostly been used to secure different types of communications between a local machine and a remote host, including:
  - Secure remote access to resources.
  - Remote execution of commands.
  - Delivery of software patches and updates.
  - Interactive and automated file transfers.

<h4>UFW</h4>

UFW, or uncomplicated firewall, is a frontend for managing firewall rules in Arch Linux, Debian, or Ubuntu. UFW is used through the command line, and aims to make firewall configuration easy.

By default, UFW is set to deny all incoming connections and allow all outgoing connections. This means anyone trying to reach your server would not be able to connect, while any application within the server would be able to reach the outside world.
